## Project Name:

IMDb Dataset Analysis

## Introduction: 

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the IMDb dataset. The IMDb dataset is a rich source of information about various movies, including details like titles, genres, budget, revenues, and more. In this project, we aim to explore this dataset to gain insights into the world of movies. By analyzing the dataset, we can uncover trends, patterns, and interesting facts about movies and the film industry.

## Project Objectives: 

The primary objectives of this IMDb dataset analysis project are as follows:


**1) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** 
  
  * Remove duplicate entries and handle missing values.

**2) General Insights:** 
  
  * Display the total number of movies in the dataset.
  * Doing statastical analysis on numeric columns such as Budget and Revenue.
  * Finding correlation between columns.

**3) Revenue Analysis:**

  * Finding and plotting top 10 revenue from all the dataset.
  * Finding and plotting total revenue from all the countries.
  * Finding and plotting revenue over the year from 1903-2023.
  * Finding and plotting revenue by language for present languages.
  * Visualize the findings to better understand revenue analysis.
